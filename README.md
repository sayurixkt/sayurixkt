### ˗ˏˋGreetings, people of the Earth´ˎ˗

  My name is Sayuri Kobayashi and I am 23 years old. Born and raised in São Paulo - Brazil, I have a passion for ⋆ aesthetic ⋆ things, so expect me to always be my perfectionist self and put my mind and heart on everything that I commit (pun intended).
  I am midway in my Computer Science Bachelor's Degree and even though I'm somewhat new to this area, I couldn't be happier with my choice of career •ᴗ•
  I'm currently an intern at Presence Tecnologia and my work is focused on software implantation
